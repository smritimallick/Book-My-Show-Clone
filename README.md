## Description : 
I've created a clone of this website which has similar functionlity as the official website. In this website, I've used React.js to build the front-end of this website and MovieDB for the back-end server.

I've used several technologies such as React.js, Tailwind CSS , React-slick (package for sliders/carousel), React-icons (package for icons), React-context-api (state management), Axios (to fetch data from API) and Headless UI.

I've also used Razorpay API to enable the payment gateway. 

## To run this project : 
We need to create a new react project using the below command :

```bash
npx create-react-app [my-project]
```

Then, we'll install tailwind and its peer dependencies via npm :
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then, we import all the necessary packages and start writing the code. Finally, to deploy the project we use :

```bash
npm run start
```
